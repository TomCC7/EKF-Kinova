# EKF-RLFJ-Robot
An Extended Kalman Filter for Real-Time Estimation and Control of a Rigid-Link Flexible-Joint Manipulator

High performance tracking of an industrial robot depends on accurate expression of manipulator dynamics. When a robot has flexible joints efficient model parametrization will be difficult to achieve. In this project an extended Kalman filter (EKF) observer to estimate manipulator states is presented.
